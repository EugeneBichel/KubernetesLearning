Containerized applications created by Docker are still 100% supported in Kubernetes. 
This is because Kubernetes and Docker both work with container images based on the standards set by the Open Container Initiative (OCI).

The process of building an application into a container image is called containerization. 
When the process is completed, the application is said to be containerized.
As a result, you will be using the terms container image and containerized application interchangeably.
